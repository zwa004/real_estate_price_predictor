## Introduction

Residential house prices are complex to predict and understand. While interest rates, buyer/seller financial status, and other factors can help to predict house prices, they are not the only variables affecting home sales. This project aims to:

* Explore data available for house sales
* Extract features from data
* Train various machine learning models
* Test the models
* Visualize the results in a dashboard
* Identify areas for future research and more complex analysis

## Data

* Aggregating data into to single csv
* Cleaning data
* Normalizing data

### Data Transformation
* Find single family sales
* Assign bulk sales
* Test skew
* Identify outliers

### Feature Engineering
